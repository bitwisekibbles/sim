# Sim

Sim is a programming language which attempts to be *extremely* simple to use. Sim draws heavy inspiration from Batch and even allows some batch like operations; however, all ties with the windows environment have been cut. Instead, Sim provides an operating system agnostic platform for writing quick scripts and unlike batch can be compiled into a binary or interpreted. When compiled, binaries are simply translated into C code and compiled using the local compiler.
